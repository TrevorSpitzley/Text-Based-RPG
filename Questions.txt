1.) Can I have the health points and attack mod of a monster set at the top of the class(Show code for better explanation)
and then pass those attributes as parameters to the super constructor? Or would that mean whatever random values are created will be the same for all Vamps/Weres/Zombs/Ghouls created? (Show code for better explanation)

2.) When I want to decrease a monster's health points, do I need to do 'self.super.health_points'? 
Or since it inherits health_points from the NPC class can i just use 'self.health_points'?

3.) Observer pattern for when a monster dies and turns into a human

4***.) When I create a monster, v = Vampire(), does the way I have my code setup make it so I don't have to pass parameters 
in the 'v = Vampire()' call? Because I am setting those in the call to 'super.__init__(x, y)' in the respective monsters 
constructor? (Show code for better explanation)

5.) In the player.py class, I want to create a list that can only hold 10 elements. Should I just write my function in a way that 
it only puts 10 items into a list and no more, or is the way I have it written now a valid way to limit how many
things can be appended to the list? (Show code for better explanation)

6.) For my import statements in House.py and Player.py, do I need to say 'import Zombie.py' with the '.py' extension 
specifically? Or is saying 'import Zombie' correct?
