1.) Go to main and error check the input number you receive for weapon selection. 
Should be easy just can't go over len(list) - 1

2.) Implement a drop mechanism for weapons. When a monster gets hit, pass the player in the update function.
Then in the NPC class, under the if statement for health == 0, append a randomly generated weapon to player weapon list.
********* Consider just making a function in player called "generate_random_weapon" for better readability
